To play Amiga games in ipf format requires capsimg.so. The aarch64 version for Android doesn't seem to work on rg351 devices. Normally this file is located in:

/usr/lib/libcapsimage.so.5.1

If you can find it on your system copy it from there, otherwise download capsimg.so from this repository and put capsimg.so in your bios folder.
